            Sucker Punch’s samurai game was released back in 2020 for the
            PlayStation 4, signalling the end of the console’s time in the
            spotlight. Experience the turbulent life of Jin Sakai as he tries to
            hold off the Mongol Empire from conquering the East. The former
            console exclusive title is heading to the PC later this year, with
            all the bells and whistles you might expect from an expertly crafted
            port. Ghost of Tsushima was already a stunning looking game, but the
            Ghost of Tsushima system requirements should ensure you’re able to
            experience the action-adventure game even on portable PC gaming
            devices. <br /><br />The Ghost of Tsushima PC release date is set
            for Thursday, May 16, 2024. Sony is bringing the Ghost of Tsushima
            Director’s Cut version over to the Steam and Epic Game Store, giving
            players access to the Iki Island expansion and the multiplayer game
            mode, Legends. The port is being developed by Nixxes Software, a
            studio that was purchased by Sony back in 2021 to bring first-party
            PlayStation games to PC. Not every Sony first-party port has been
            perfect, like The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered which saw Naughty Dog
            issue an apology, but the games released by Nixxes have generally
            been well received by critics. The last game ported to PC by Nixxes
            was Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart which utilized Windows 11 Direct
            Storage for seamless loading.

            further beyond what was capable on the PlayStation 5. Given the
            quality of the best gaming monitors right now, you can play Ghost of
