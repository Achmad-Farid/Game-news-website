            The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will reportedly get a PC port soon,
            which will be announced next month. This is according to Twitter
            user Silknigth, who recently leaked the announcement of Ghost of
            Tsushima's own PC port ahead of time. <br /><br />
            While their latest claim that The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will
            launch on PC is far from confirmed, Silknigth has a good track
            record, also leaking the day that Xbox's ports to PlayStation and
            Switch were announced. According to Silknigth, this latest PC port
            will be unveiled next month, not long after the remaster launched on
            PS5. <br /><br />
            Silknigth doesn't give us a specific timeframe for when it will
            launch but does suggest in a reply that it could be with us before
            the second season of The Last of Us on HBO. This is filming now and
            is set to premiere in 2025, so the game may come to PC at some point
            this year.

              Sony&#39;s upcoming PC game is The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered.
              Its announcement is expected next month, although the exact date
              is unknown. There will be a longer-than-usual period between the
              announcement date and the release day.<a

            Twitter user Silknigth — who’s quickly garnered a reputation for
            their accurate leaks — claims that although TLOU2 Remastered will be
            announced for PC next month, there will be a relatively long gap
            between its announcement and release. Nixxes Software — the studio
            dedicated to porting Sony’s games to PC — is currently busy working
            on bringing Sucker Punch Productions’ Ghost of Tsushima to Steam.
            <br /><br />
            TLOU2 Remastered’s PC release was only a question of “when.” Sony
            has made it clear that it’ll bring more of its first-party games to
            PC following their console launches. In case of multiplayer games,
            the company is experimenting with day-and-date launches as seen in
            the case of Helldivers 2. However, day-and-date releases for
            single-player games still doesn’t seem to be on the menu.
