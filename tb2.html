            Originating from an ambitious project that continued to generate
            massive hype across various social media platforms and ultimately
            culminated in a substandard action game product, the Indonesian game
            - Troublemaker crafted by Gamecom Team still has plenty of room to
            grow and evolve. With strong signals that they will continue to
            expand the story and world they have created, it turns out we don't
            have to wait too long until a sequel series is voiced to the public.
            Leveraging the IGDX Game Showcase 2023 event, Gamecom officially
            announced the sequel series - Troublemaker 2: Beyond Dream.
            <br /><br />
            Not only just a teaser, this announcement also comes with a debut
            trailer showcasing a world that is no longer "trapped" in the school
            atmosphere like its first series, as well as confirmation of the two
            protagonist system - Jordan and Budi. Melee combat action still
            appears to be a focal point along with its signature finishing
            animations, now also supported by more mini-games, including band
            performances. Gamecom Team also ensures that key characters from its
            first series will return in this sequel series. <br /><br />
            Troublemaker 2: Beyond Dream itself is currently planned to be
            released in the upcoming year of 2025, with an exact release date
            yet to be determined.

            The game Troublemaker 2: Beyond Dream will feature a different game
            genre, namely becoming an open-world game. This sequel game will be
            set in a fictional world called South Jayakarta, a city depicted as
            a diverse city in Indonesia. With the concept of an open world,
            players can freely explore interesting places and discover some
            unexpected things.

            In this sequel game, you actually have 2 available characters that
            can be used. So, you can play with 2 different characters, one as
            Jordan or a member of the band Beyond Dream, and the other as Budi,
            a member of the Parakacuk gang. Both of them will overcome all
            obstacles to pursue their goals.
