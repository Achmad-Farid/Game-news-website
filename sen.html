            Sentinels are once again the undisputed best Valorant team in the
            world. SEN have proven themselves as the kings of Valorant,
            clinching a thrilling 3-2 victory against Pacific region team Gen.G
            Esports in the Masters Madrid grand final. <br /><br />
            The team’s Masters Madrid win positions them at the forefront of the
            Valorant Champions 2024 qualifier race, with three additional VCT
            championship points secured. The win also underscores the team’s
            remarkable performance since finalizing their roster, securing their
            third consecutive tournament victory. <br /><br />
            Sentinels have won the VCT Masters Madrid after defeating Gen.G
            Esports in the tournament's Grand Final. The Americans have taken
            the trophy home almost three years after winning the VCT Masters
            Reykjavík. The South Korean lineup began the match with a terrific
            advantage over Sentinels as the golden roster was given the two
            series map bans due to having won the main bracket. Despite Gen.G
            Esports' advantage off the server, the team from the VCT Pacific
            couldn't bring the trophy home.

            Sentinel can win the tournament because sen win againts gen with
            score 3-2, with the results: 8-13 Breeze, 14-12 Bind, 8-13 Ascent,
            13-10 Split, 13-6 Icebox. While the final result wasn't what Gen.G
            Esports hoped, the South Koreans had a rock-solid start to the grand
            finals with a brutal victory on Breeze. Eventually, the golden
            roster was on the verge of securing the second map of the series as
            they headed to the eighteenth round winning by three rounds (10-7). <br><br>
            It was then when Sentinels woke up after five successful defenses
            the Americans reached match point. Although the South Koreans ended
            up sending their opponents to overtime, Sentinels closed the map.
            Right when Sentinels started to pick up the pace, Gen.G Esports
            stopped the Americans with another one sided win, this time on
            Ascent (13-8). <br><br> Another map and the South Koreans would win the
            game.Unfortunately for the Asian roster, Zachary "zekken" Patrone
            went berserk for Sentinels on Split as the American got an ACS of
            366 and 29 kills on the fourth map alone. His individual performance
            made the final difference as Sentinels forced the fifth map.
            Finally, Icebox was the most one-sided map of the series. After
            swapping roles with a 7-5 advantage, the Americans took control of
            the map as they looked almost unstoppable on the attacking side.
            Eventually, the red roster won the map (and the championship). With
            this result, Sentinels claimed the victory at the VCT Masters Madrid
            and currently have 6 VCT Americas Championship points.
