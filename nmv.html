            Night Market is an awaited event that adds a dash of excitement to
            VALORANT. In this special limited-time event, users are presented
            with a chance to purchase weapon skins at discounted prices.
            However, there's a catch, the Night Market offers random skins, so
            each market is personalized and randomized. Here's all we know about
            VALORANT February 2024 Night Market. Night market will start at
            January 31 and will end in February 28,2024. You will find lots of
            cool weapon skins at cheap prices. However, it is not yet known what
            weapon skins will be present at this event until now.

            In simple terms, the Night Market is a special store that's only
            available at a certain time each season. This store offers a
            collection of six weapon skins, which are selected at random for
            each player and cannot be changed or rerolled. <br /><br />
            What's special about it is that the cosmetics are usually discounted
            and you can get skins from the Select, Deluxe, and/or Premium tiers.
            The discount applied to each item is random and it ranges between
            10% and 49%. <br /><br />
            Unfortunately, there are some restrictions on the skins that can
            appear in this store. Gear skins, Battle Pass skins, and Tactical
            Knife priced above 3550 are not part of the pool of cosmetics that
            might pop up in your store. Similarly, any gun skin of the Exclusive
            or Ultra tier is also excluded from showing up. <br /><br />

            The skins offered in the VALORANT Night Market differ based on your
            account. While some accounts might get a vandal or a phantom, others
            might get a few pistols.
