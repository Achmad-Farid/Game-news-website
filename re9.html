            The next mainline game in the Resident Evil series reportedly could
            be an open-world game. Capcom has yet to make any sort of
            announcement. <br /><br />
            According to insider Dusk Golem, Resident Evil 9 is being built on
            the open-world functionality of the RE Engine that was first
            utilized for Dragon's Dogma 2. Monster Hunter Wild is reportedly
            another open-world game on the RE Engine. Capcom apparently
            greenlights its projects in groups of three, so Resident Evil 7,
            Resident Evil 2 remake, and Devil May Cry 5 were reportedly approved
            close to each other to take advantage of the RE Engine. So when
            looking to expand the RE Engine's capabilities to create open-world
            games, Capcom reportedly greenlit Dragon's Dogma 2, Monster Hunter
            Wild, and Resident Evil 9. <br /><br />
            Capcom has not officially announced Resident Evil 9. However, back
            in July 2023, Dusk Golem said that it could be announced in Fall
            2024 with a 2025 release date. It's also reportedly the biggest game
            in the series to date.

          <h2>
            <p>The Pros of Resident Evil 9 Potentially Going Open-World</p>
          </h2>
          <div class="Gambar1">

          <p>
            Potentially the biggest upside of Resident Evil 9 going open-world
            is that it would offer a completely new experience. Over the last
            few years, the Resident Evil series has gotten into a successful
            rhythm of bouncing between remakes and mainline sequels. <br />
            <br />
            But with an open world, Resident Evil 9 could offer something
            completely new. Though Resident Evil Village's more open-ended map
            gave a brief tease of what an open-world Resident Evil could look
            like, it wasn't the whole package. Being able to tackle Resident
            Evil 9's areas and bosses in any order could be genuinely
            refreshing, and add a nice layer of player freedom that isn't always
            present in Resident Evil. <br /><br />
            Embracing an open-world design would also likely mean that Resident
            Evil 9 is a tad longer than its predecessors. The vast majority of
            Resident Evil games can be finished in under 15 hours, and while
            this is never usually a knock against the series, it might be nice
            to live in these horrifying worlds for a little bit longer,
            especially if that means more enemy types, more puzzles, more
            collectibles, and more rewarding side activities.

          <p>
            But delivering a compelling open world is much easier said than
            done. While Resident Evil 9 adopting an open-world structure could
            offer a refreshing break from tradition, it could also backfire
            immensely. If Resident Evil 9's rumored open world didn't really
            capitalize on its new structure, then it might call into question
            why Capcom even bothered to change the tried and tested formula, and
            it wouldn't be the first time. <br /><br />
            This criticism would only be exacerbated by the context surrounding
            Resident Evil 9. There are already immense expectations for the next
            mainline entry of Resident Evil as a long-running horror franchise
            and it might not be the best time for Capcom to experiment with a
            new open-world formula for the series. Instead, an open-world design
            might be best introduced in a future Resident Evil spin-off, where
            there's much less pressure to knock it out of the park right away.
